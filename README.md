# DutchGrit - Afas OData Server - for Power BI

The DutchGrit Afas OData Server is a (free) Desktop application which forms a easy to use bridge between Power BI and the Online Afas GetConnector API's. The only thing you need is your Afas number and a valid Token. 

The application automaticly detects the available GetConnectors in your token and translates any OData query into GetConnector API call's on the fly. 

> The application acts as a bridge. No data is preloaded or stored! 

## Usage

1. Download the application from the release tab above. Choose the approriate x86/x64 release. The release files are big because we ship the .NET Core 3.1 framework along with it for convenience.

2. Fill in you number and token and hit Start Server.

Wait for the message that server is started. You can find it at http://localhost:5000/odata

3. Start Power BI Desktop, Get Data and choose OData Feed.

## OData Server details

If you want to use the OData Server outside the context of Power BI, it is useful to know which OData Query options are provided.

The following OData query options are implemented and delegated automaticly to the GetConnector API:

- `$top` 
    - We set a maximum top of 10000. 
- `$skip` 
- `$orderBy` 

A `$skip` without `$top` is not supported.

The following OData options are implemented, but handled locally (after the GetConnector has send it's data) 

- `$select`
- `$filter` 
    - we have plans to delegate the filter as well.

Sample (assuming that ProfitVATcode is included in your GetConnectors) 

http://localhost:5000/odata/ProfitVATcode?$skip=10&$top=10
http://localhost:5000/odata/ProfitVATcode?$orderBy=Description
http://localhost:5000/odata/ProfitVATcode?$filter=VatType%20eq%20%27V%27

## Troubles

Please leave an issue at this Github repository or contact us at [DutchGrit](https://www.dutchgrit.nl).

Known issues 
- You need to restart the application whenever you change your GetConnectors. The application only reads the definitions on start.
- Some connectors are SLOW : be carefull with some of the built-in connectors like: ProfitPeriodeBalance, ProfitPeriodsPerAdministration.
